  It is a fun spin on the original website, imagining a world where bats are the primary inhabitants of the homes. As such, the architecture is creatively imagined as other-worldy and dreamy place that would be cozy for a family of bats. All imagery was created with that in mind, using Midjourney.

This project is divided into 3 parts:

1. The Frontend
3. PostgresQL database
3. Express Server

## The Frontend
The frontend is a REACT/REDUX application that communicates with the RESTful API. It is responsible for rendering the website and handling user interactions.

## PostgresQL database
The database is a PostgresQL database that stores all the data for the website. It is responsible for storing user data, spot data, and booking data.

## Express Server
The Express server is a Node.js application that communicates with the PostgresQL database. It is responsible for handling all the requests from the frontend, validating data, running basic calculations, and returning the appropriate data.

To Run:
Clone Repo
npm install in root, frontend, backend
backend: `npm start build` 
frontend: `npm run dev`
